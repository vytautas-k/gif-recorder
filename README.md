# gif-recorder
Simple script to record desktop in gif format. Kudos to [TheMichaelHu](https://gist.github.com/TheMichaelHu/d8ad0ae031f78cc65b795d8f107a845f), which script was used here as a base.

## Installation

To use this script you need to install xrectsel (from https://github.com/lolilolicon/xrectsel/) and byzanz (sudo apt-get install byzanz).

## Suggestion

Throw this script somewhere you like and make an alias like "gif" for easier usage.
